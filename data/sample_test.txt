This is okay for chopping cilantro, but does not puree very well.
I my mind it does not live up to the Cuisinart name.
My original mini prep had a sharp blade, not a serrated blade.
I got one about 2 or 3 weeks ago and I'm sending it back.
I have put no more than 1/2 cup at a time, of nuts, pieces of cut up carrots, etc.
This is more of a packing review than a review of product.
The book does what it's intended to do.
It came in 24 hours so I was grateful for that.
This book is great for beginner fondant makers.
I was able to follow the instructions and tips and they helped a lot.

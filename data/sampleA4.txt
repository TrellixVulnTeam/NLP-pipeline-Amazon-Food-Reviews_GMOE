I'm pretty happy with this matte black case kannav dhawan gaurav.
It has glossy sides, which make for a nice sticky grip when holding the phone, but the matte back slides very easy into my pocket.
I'm glad I didn't get the glossy back, as it feels like it would be more sticky than slippery.
I am a little upset that there is a "TC" on the back of the matte cases, but I can get over that.
I was happy enough with this, but it gave the back cover a strange shine.
Moreover, the bezel part of the skin would peel up sometimes in my pocket and get lint under it.
I left the skin on the phone and carefully installed the TPU case around it.
As cases though, it's not the best, but it's certainly not the worst, and it's a good value.
Not a lot to complain about with this case at this price.
I was happy with the TPU case I bought for my Incredible 2, and bought another for my new Rezound.
It fits the phone perfectly, the cut outs are all spot on, nice looking, not too bulky.
Volume is hard to control with the case on, but then the Rezound's volume controls aren't that easy to use in the first place.
I'd suggest picking up Call of Duty 2, its half the price and at least 5 times as good.
There are hardly ANY maps for CTF and Warfare gametypes and the rest of the gametypes are basically just different types of deathmatch.
Overall this game was a total letdown and your better off finding a copy of the original UT or downloading Nexuiz.
I have played all Turok games in the past and was interested in this one.
The game started very well - interesting environments, cool weapons, a very innovative "button-reaction-time" way to kill dinosaurs with a knife.
I said "Whoa! I'm gonna like this game!"UNFORTUNATELY.
Towards the end of the first third of the game, it became insanely difficult.
There were cases where I would finally find the hiding point behind the rock, and I still got killed RIGHT THROUGH THE ROCK.
So you die, and you die, and you die, and you die, and you die, and you die.
well, you get the picture.If I don't like a game, I usually put it away for good.
